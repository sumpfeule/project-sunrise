Trying to build a sunrise-simulating alarm clock

This project is currently in a very early stage.  Don't expect much yet :)

What will this be once it's finished? Build instructions for an Arduino-controlled LED strip simulating the color change and brightness of a sunrise for use as an alarm clock. If everything goes well.
